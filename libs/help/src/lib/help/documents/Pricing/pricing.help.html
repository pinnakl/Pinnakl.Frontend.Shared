          The Pricing screen is used to price the portfolio. Prices for
          instruments, such as equities, options, preferreds, and futures, that
          trade on the exchange are sourced from IDC. Prices for bonds and other
          structured products are sourced via an external evaluated pricing
          service. Other instruments like bank debt, trade claims do not have a
          pricing feed and have to be priced manually. The pricing screen
          workflow involves ensuring all prices received from the evaluated
          pricing source are correct and prices for instruments that are not
          available via the evaluated pricing source are inputted.
